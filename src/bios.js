    As my first job out of college, Infosys will always have a special place in my heart. 
    Infosys provided numerous opportunities for me to grow both my soft skills and my technical skills.
    During my time here, I was able to work on various projects ranging from banks to pharmaceutical companies, each with their own unique cultures and toolsets to master.
    What I am the most grateful for from Infosys is the resources they have provided me. 
    Without the environment they provided, I would never have become the developer that I am today.

export const COWORKERS_DESC = `
When I first joined Infosys and started learning ReactJS to become a full-stack web developer, I created "Meet Your Coworkers" as a project to hone my skills.
The goal of this website was to give my coworkers at my Indianapolis office a site to connect with other coworkers and promote a sense of community within our company.
A vast majority of us were recent college graduates who relocated from across the US. 
This website would serve as a page for us get to know each other better, see what projects we had been on, what our tech interests were, and what skills we were trained in.

On one Summer day in 2019, just as I was beginning my job search for the year, my younger brother asked me "If you're a web-developer, shouldn't you have your own website?"
I realized he was absolutely right.

Interact is a branch of the Rotary International organization geared towards bringing young people together to develop leadership skills by organizing community service events.

Being born in the 90s, I grew up with the internet and saw the giant leaps web-tech made in only a few years.
By the time I was in high school, I was intrigued with computers and how the internet functioned. 
Having already been a part of my school's Interact club as a member, I came on as their board's webmaster in 2012 and was in charge of their wordpress website.
