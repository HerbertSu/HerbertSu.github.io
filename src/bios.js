    As my first job out of college, Infosys will always have a special place in my heart. 
    Infosys provided numerous opportunities for me to grow both my soft skills and my technical skills.
    During my time here, I was able to work on various projects ranging from banks to pharmaceutical companies, each with their own unique cultures and toolsets to master.
    What I am the most grateful for from Infosys is the resources they have provided me. 
    Without the environment they provided, I would never have become the developer that I am today.
